<h2>Summarize the results of a two-dimensional genome scan</h2>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
Summarize the interesting aspects of the results of <code><a href="scantwo.html">scantwo</a></code>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
## S3 method for class 'scantwo':
summary(object, thresholds, 
        what=c("best", "full", "add", "int"),
        perms, alphas, lodcolumn=1, pvalues=FALSE,
        df=FALSE, allpairs=TRUE, ...)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>object</code></td>
<td>
An object of class <code>scantwo</code>, the output of the
function <code><a href="scantwo.html">scantwo</a></code>.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>thresholds</code></td>
<td>
A vector of length 5, giving LOD thresholds
for the full, conditional-interactive, interaction, additive, and
conditional-additive LOD scores. See Details, below.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>what</code></td>
<td>
Indicates for which LOD score the maximum should be
reported. See Details, below.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>perms</code></td>
<td>
Optional permutation results used to derive thresholds or
to calculate genome-scan-adjusted p-values.  This must be consistent
with the <code>object</code> input, in that it must have the same number of
LOD score columns.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>alphas</code></td>
<td>
If perms are included, these are the significance levels used
to calculate thresholds for determining which peaks to pull out.  It
should be a vector of length 5, giving significance levels 
for the full, conditional-interactive, interaction, additive, and
conditional-additive LOD scores.  (It can also be a single number, in
which case it is assumed that the same value is used for all five LOD
scores.)  If <code>thresholds</code> is specified, <code>alphas</code> should not
be.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>lodcolumn</code></td>
<td>
If the scantwo results contain LOD scores for
multiple phenotypes, this argument indicates which to use in the
summary.  Only one LOD score column may be considered at a time.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>pvalues</code></td>
<td>
If TRUE, include columns with genome-scan-adjusted
p-values in the results.  This requires that <code>perms</code> be
provided.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>df</code></td>
<td>
If TRUE, the degrees of freedom associated with the LOD
scores are shown.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>allpairs</code></td>
<td>
If TRUE, all pairs of chromosomes are considered.  If
FALSE, only self-self pairs are considered, so that one may more
conveniently check for possible linked QTL.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
Ignored at this point.</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>
If <code>what="best"</code>, we calculate, for each pair of chromosomes, the
maximum LOD score for the full model (two QTL plus interaction) and
the maximum LOD score for the additive model.  The difference between
these is a LOD score for a test for interaction.  We also calculate
the difference between the maximum full LOD and the maximum single-QTL LOD
score for the two chromosomes; this is the LOD score for a test for a
second QTL, allowing for epistasis, which we call either the
conditional-interactive or "fv1" LOD score.  Finally,
we calculate the difference between the maximum additive LOD score and
the maximum single-QTL LOD score for the two chromosomes; this is the
LOD score for a test for a second QTL, assuming that the two QTL act
additively, which we call either the conditional-additive or "av1" LOD
score.  Note that the maximum full LOD and additive LOD are allowed to
occur in different places. 
</p>
<p>
If <code>what="full"</code>, we find the maximum full LOD and extract the
additive LOD at the corresponding pair of positions; we derive
the other three LOD scores for that fixed pair of positions.
</p>
<p>
If <code>what="add"</code>, we find the maximum additive LOD and extract the
full LOD  at the corresponding pair of positions; we derive
the other three LOD scores for that fixed pair of positions.
</p>
<p>
If <code>what="int"</code>, we find the pair of positions for which the
difference between the full and additive LOD scores is largest, and
then calculate the five LOD scores at that pair of positions.
</p>
<p>
If <code>thresholds</code> or <code>alphas</code> is provided (and note that when
<code>alphas</code> is provided, <code>perms</code> must also), we extract just
those pairs of chromosomes for which either (a) the full LOD score
exceeds its thresholds and either the conditional-interactive LOD or
the interaction LOD exceed their threshold, or (b) the additive LOD
score exceeds its threshold and the conditional-additive LOD exceeds
its threshold.  The thresholds or alphas must be given in the order
full, cond-int, int, add, cond-add. 
</p>
<p>
Thresholds may be obtained by a permutation test with
<code><a href="scantwo.html">scantwo</a></code>, but these are extremely time-consuming.
For a mouse backcross, we suggest the thresholds (6.0, 4.7, 4.4, 4.7,
2.6) for the full, conditional-interactive, interaction, additive, and
conditional-additive LOD scores, respectively.  
For a mouse intercross, we suggest the thresholds (9.1, 7.1, 6.3, 6.3,
3.3) for the full, conditional-interactive, interaction, additive, and
conditional-additive LOD scores, respectively.  These were obtained by
10,000 simulations of crosses with 250 individuals, markers at a 10 cM
spacing, and analysis by Haley-Knott regression.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>
An object of class <code>summary.scantwo</code>, to be printed by
<code>print.summary.scantwo</code>;</p>

<h3>Output of addpair</h3>

<p>
<B>Note</B> that, for output from <code><a href="addpair.html">addpair</a></code> in which the
new loci are indicated explicitly in the formula, the summary provided
by <code>summary.scantwo</code> is somewhat special.
</p>
<p>
All arguments except <code>allpairs</code> and <code>thresholds</code> (and, of
course, the input <code>object</code>) are ignored.
</p>
<p>
If the formula is symmetric in the two new QTL, the output has just two LOD
score columns: <code>lod.2v0</code> comparing the full model to the model
with neither of the new QTL, and <code>lod.2v1</code> comparing the full
model to the model with just one new QTL.
</p>
<p>
If the formula is <EM>not</EM> symmetric in the two new QTL, the output
has three LOD score columns: <code>lod.2v0</code> comparing the full model
to the model with neither of the new QTL, <code>lod.2v1b</code> comparing
the full model to the model in which the first of the new QTL is
omitted, and <code>lod.2v1a</code> comparing the full model to the model
with the second of the new QTL omitted.  
</p>
<p>
The <code>thresholds</code> argument should have length 1 or 2, rather than
the usual 5.  Rows will be retained if <code>lod.2v0</code> is greater than
<code>thresholds[1]</code> and <code>lod.2v1</code> (or either of <code>lod.2v1a</code>
or <code>lod.2v1b</code>) is greater than <code>thresholds[2]</code>.  (If a
single thresholds is given, we assume that <code>thresholds[2]==0</code>.)
</p>


<h3>The older version</h3>

<p>
The previous version of this function is still available, though it is
now named <code><a href="summary.scantwo.old.html">summary.scantwo.old</a></code>.
</p>
<p>
We much prefer the revised function.  However, while we are confident
that this function (and the permutations in
<code><a href="scantwo.html">scantwo</a></code>) are calculating the relevant statistics,
the appropriate significance levels for these relatively complex
series of statistical tests is not yet completely clear.
